This is an on-going project that aims to synthesize lifelike hands via popular generative models (e.g., StyleGAN, Stable Diffusion), advised by professor [Greg Turk](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/). Here's the preliminary research proposal: [proposal](https://yy-gx.github.io/assets/pdf/Proposal_hand_synthesize.pdf).
