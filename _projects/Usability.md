This is a project I led when I was Information and Interaction Lab @ School of Design for over 2 year. And published as the first author in ISTE ‘22 conference.    

Here’s the project paper link:
- Xiang, Y., Chang, D., Yao, Y., Wang, L., Chen, A., & Li, J. (2022). Usability Evaluation of Elder-Friendly Design: Application to Take Alipay App. In Transdisciplinarity and the Future of Engineering (pp. 154-163), IOS Press, https://doi.org/10.3233/ATDE220642.


With the permeation of mobile intelligent devices, various applications have become necessary for people to obtain essential services. Although many apps claim that they have considered the use of seniors and developed elder-friendly modes, research has shown that there are still significant problems for senior people in actually using these apps.

Previous studies have shown that when designing for middle-aged and elderly people, their physical characteristics and cognitive abilities need to be especially considered. 

# Research Problem
Explore the **usability** and **learnability** problem of the elder-friendly design for the real elder people in mobile apps.

    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/project_imgs/p2_2.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

</div>



As the most popular App in China (like PayPal), Alipay's normal mode and elder-friendly mode will be compared in this research, and their usability and learnability will be emphatically analyzed.

# Methodology and Experiment Design
The purpose of our experiment is to verify whether the **elder-friendly mode** significantly improves the **usability** of middle-aged and elderly people compared with the **normal mode**. 

We take Alipay App as an example in this experiment to conduct research from the aspects of **information architecture**, **interface design**, and **task flow**.

Based on the evaluation results, design improvement strategies suitable for senior users will be proposed.
